                    With over 50+ unique attributes your Hippos will be truly
                    one of a kind No two Hippos will be the same. Each Hippos is
                    generated with attributes based on rarity. Your Hippo is
                    built and stored on Solana blockchain with ownership All
                    Hippos live on the Solana blockchain. This allows collectors
                    to buy, sell and trade Hippos with collectors from around
                    the world.
